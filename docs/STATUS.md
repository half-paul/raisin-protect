## Sprint Progress

| Agent | Progress | Status | Notes |
|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| SA | 5/5 (100%) | ✅ DONE | All design work complete |
| DBE | 6/6 (100%) | ✅ DONE | All migrations + seeds complete |
| DEV-BE | 0/16 (0%) | 🟢 UNBLOCKED | DBE migrations ready — can start |
| DEV-FE | 0/10 (0%) | 🔴 BLOCKED | Waiting on DEV-BE scaffolding + auth |
| CR | 0/7 (0%) | 🔴 BLOCKED | Waiting on code to review |
| QA | 0/5 (0%) | 🔴 BLOCKED | Waiting on testable code |

**Overall Sprint Completion:** 11/59 tasks (19%)

## Dependency Chain Status
```
SA [DONE] → DBE [DONE] → DEV-BE [UNBLOCKED] → CR [BLOCKED] → QA [BLOCKED]
                                     ↘ DEV-FE [BLOCKED] → CR ↗
```

## Blockers
**CRITICAL PATH:** Backend Developer (DEV-BE) — ⚠️ STALLED
- SA and DBE both complete — all prerequisites ready
- DEV-BE has 16 tasks, 0 started
- **STALLED:** DEV-BE is unblocked but has not committed any code yet
- DEV-FE waiting on scaffolding + auth endpoints (needs 5+ BE tasks done)
- CR and QA waiting for code to review/test

**Action Required:** DEV-BE needs to start immediately. Focus on:
1. Go module init and directory structure
2. Config package and database connection
3. Docker setup
4. Auth endpoints (register, login, refresh, logout)
5. Health endpoints
